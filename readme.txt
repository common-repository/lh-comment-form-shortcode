Shortcodes to display comment forms and comment listings inline on any post, page, or cpt!

== Description ==

Include a comment form or listing on any post, page, or CPT inline in the post_content of another page.

Simply add the shortcodes lh_comment_form_shortcode_form or lh_comment_form_shortcode_list to you content in the editor. Both shortcodes have one mandatory attribute.

The mandatory attribute is post_id, this is the id of the post, page, or cpt whose comment form you want displayed.If that attribute i not specified it will defaut to the current page (which is not that useful)

eg [lh_comment_form_shortcode_form post_id="100"] or [lh_comment_form_shortcode_list post_id="100"]

A gutenberg block with this functionality will be added in time.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is something does not work?  =

LH Comment Form Shortcode and Block, and all [https://lhero.org](LocalHero) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-comment-form-shortcode-block/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-comment-form-shortcode-block/). I look there regularly and resolve most queries.
